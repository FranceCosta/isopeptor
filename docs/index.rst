Isopeptor Documentation
=======================
Python package for the detection of intamolecular isopeptide bonds in protein structures.  
The method is described in **Isopeptor: a tool for detecting intramolecular isopeptide bonds in protein structures**.

Intramolecular Isopeptide bonds
-------------------------------
Intramolecular isopeptide bonds typically form between lysine and asparagine/aspartate residues, 
typically catalyzed by a nearby aspartate or glutamate. 
When found in β-sandwich folds, they occur in CnaA domains (linking β-strands of opposing β-sheets) and 
CnaB domains (linking adjacent β-strands of the same β-sheet). 
They stabilize protein structures against various stresses.
